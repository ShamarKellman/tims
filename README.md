# TIMS (Teachers Information Management System)

TIMS (Teachers Information Management System) is a platform for teachers in Barbados to share their class information and resources.

### Tech

TIMS uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Laravel 7.0](https://laravel.com/) - The PHP Framework for Web Artisans
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

Of course, TIMS itself is open source with a [public repository - https://github.com/ShamarKellman/tims.git](https://github.com/ShamarKellman/tims.git)
 on GitHub.
